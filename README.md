# Incorrect Early Return in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving incorrect early returns in conditional statements. The function `foo` is supposed to add two numbers but prematurely returns 0 if either input is 0. This is incorrect behavior.  The solution corrects this by accurately calculating the sum before returning.
